## About Me

I recently obtained a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from National Taiwan University. I am currently applying for the ECE/CSE Graduate Program for the 2025 Fall. 
My research interests are in VLSI and Computer Architecture.
I was a summer intern at MediaTek's SoC Integration Department, designing a low-power architecture plan for the NoC structure.
During my undergraduate studies, I was advised by Prof.Yi-Chang Lu for Spliced Genomic Sequence Hardware Acceleration research, and developed resource-efficient Machine Learning Model Deployment on FPGA features in Prof. Ryan Kastner's Lab.

### Research Interests
* VLSI Design
* Computer Architecture
* Digital Circuit Design
