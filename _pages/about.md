## About Me
I received my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from National Taiwan University in 2024. I am applying for the ECE/CSE Graduate Program for the 2025 Fall. 

My research interests are in VLSI and Computer Architecture.

I was a summer intern at MediaTek's SoC Integration Department, where I designed a low-power architecture plan for the NoC structure.  

During my undergraduate studies, Prof. Yi-Chang Lu advised me on Spliced Genomic Sequence Hardware Acceleration research and developed resource-efficient Machine Learning Model Deployment on FPGA features in Prof. Ryan Kastner's Lab.

### Research Interests
* VLSI Design
* Computer Architecture
* Digital Circuit Design
